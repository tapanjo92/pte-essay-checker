CRITICAL CALIBRATION FACTS:
- Only 15% of test-takers achieve 79+
- Most competent essays score 65-75
- Average essay scores cluster around 60-70
- Perfect or near-perfect scores (85+) are extremely rare (<2%)

Essay Topic: {{TOPIC}}
Word Count: {{WORD_COUNT}} words (Requirement: 200-300)

Essay Content:

EVALUATION PROTOCOL:
==================

STEP 1: TOPIC RELEVANCE CHECK
- Completely off-topic = Automatic failure (max score: 30/90)
- Partially addresses topic = Significant penalty
- Verify essay directly answers the specific question asked

STEP 2: SYSTEMATIC ERROR DETECTION
Count ALL errors without exception. Average PTE essays contain:
- 8-15 grammar errors
- 5-10 vocabulary issues
- 3-5 coherence problems
- 2-4 spelling mistakes

ERROR CATEGORIES TO CHECK:

Grammar Errors (Most Common):
- Subject-verb disagreement
- Incorrect tense usage
- Article errors (a/an/the)
- Preposition mistakes
- Word form errors
- Sentence fragments
- Run-on sentences
- Incorrect conditionals

Vocabulary Issues:
- Basic/repetitive vocabulary (get, give, make, good, bad)
- Incorrect collocations
- Informal language in formal context
- Word choice errors
- Lack of academic vocabulary
- Imprecise expressions

Coherence Problems:
- Missing or weak transitions
- Paragraph unity issues
- Illogical flow of ideas
- Lack of clear topic sentences
- Weak conclusion
- Repetitive ideas

Spelling Errors:
- Any misspelled words
- Inconsistent spelling (US/UK mixing)
- Typos that create non-words

STEP 3: STRICT SCORING GUIDELINES

Content (0-3 points):
- 3: Exceptional - Fully addresses topic with sophisticated analysis, specific examples, and nuanced arguments (RARE: <5% of essays)
- 2: Good - Addresses topic well with clear arguments and some examples (TOP 20% of essays)
- 1: Adequate - Basic coverage of topic with simple arguments (MOST essays: 60%)
- 0: Poor - Off-topic, severely underdeveloped, or missing key aspects

Form (0-2 points):
- 2: Perfect structure with clear intro, 2 body paragraphs, conclusion AND 200-300 words
- 1: Minor structural issues OR slight word count deviation (Â±10%)
- 0: Major structural problems OR significant word count issues

Grammar (0-2 points):
- 2: Near-perfect grammar with complex structures correctly used (RARE: <10%)
- 1: Generally accurate with 3-7 errors that don't impede understanding (MOST essays)
- 0: Frequent errors (8+) that affect comprehension

Vocabulary (0-2 points):
- 2: Rich academic vocabulary, precise word choice, no basic words (RARE: <10%)
- 1: Mix of good and basic vocabulary, some imprecision (MOST essays: 70%)
- 0: Predominantly basic vocabulary, frequent repetition

Spelling (0-1 point):
- 1: No spelling errors
- 0: Any spelling errors (even one)

Development & Coherence (0-2 points):
- 2: Excellent progression with sophisticated transitions and clear paragraph focus (RARE)
- 1: Adequate organization with basic transitions (MOST essays: 65%)
- 0: Poor organization, missing transitions, unclear progression

Linguistic Range (0-2 points):
- 2: Wide variety of complex structures used accurately (RARE: <15%)
- 1: Some variety but mostly simple/compound sentences (MOST essays: 70%)
- 0: Limited to simple sentences or severe accuracy issues

IMPORTANT SCORING PRINCIPLES:
1. Most criteria should score 1 out of 2 for average essays
2. Reserve 2/2 scores for truly exceptional performance
3. A score of 0 indicates serious deficiency
4. Total raw scores typically range 6-10 out of 14 (43-71%)

CRITICAL REMINDERS:
- Average PTE essay scores 65-70/90
- Scores above 79 should be rare (top 15%)
- Find ALL errors - don't be lenient
- Most essays have significant room for improvement
- Be specific in feedback - vague praise doesn't help students`;
