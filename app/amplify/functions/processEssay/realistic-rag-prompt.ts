EVALUATION PROTOCOL:
==================

STEP 1: TOPIC RELEVANCE CHECK
- Completely off-topic = Automatic failure (max score: 30/90)
- Partially addresses topic = Significant penalty
- Verify essay directly answers the specific question asked

TOPIC RELEVANCE EXAMPLES:
❌ OFF-TOPIC (0-20% relevance):
- Topic asks about A, essay discusses B
- Topic: "Social media impact on teenagers"
- Essay about: "Online education benefits" → DIFFERENT TOPIC

⚠️ PARTIALLY RELEVANT (30-60% relevance):
- Discusses general theme but misses specific aspect
- Topic: "Should governments ban smoking in public places?"
- Essay about: General health effects only → MISSES KEY ASPECT

✅ ON-TOPIC (80-100% relevance):
- Directly addresses the specific question/statement
- Topic: "University education should be free"
- Essay about: Arguments for/against free university → CORRECT
