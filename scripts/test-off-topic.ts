  content: `Data storage is another area where people often make mistakes. S3 is incredible - eleven nines of durability - but you need to understand the storage classes. Intelligent-Tiering has saved my clients millions by automatically moving data between access tiers. And for databases, stop defaulting to RDS. DynamoDB can handle massive scale if you design your access patterns correctly. Single-digit millisecond response times at any scale - try getting that with traditional databases.

The real game-changer lately has been the integration of AI services. Bedrock makes it trivial to incorporate large language models into your applications. I've built RAG systems using Bedrock, OpenSearch, and Lambda that would have been impossible just two years ago.

Security-wise, always assume breach. Use IAM roles, not keys. Enable GuardDuty on day one. Set up CloudTrail for everything. And please, use Systems Manager Session Manager instead of SSH - it's more secure and you get full audit logs.

Cost optimization is where I see the biggest gaps. People provision for peak and waste money 90% of the time. Use autoscaling, leverage spot instances for non-critical workloads, and set up Cost Explorer alerts. I've seen companies cut their bills by 70% just by right-sizing their instances and using savings plans effectively.`,
