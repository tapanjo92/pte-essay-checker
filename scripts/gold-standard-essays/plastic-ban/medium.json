  "essayText": "The issue of plastic pollution has become very serious, and some people think governments should ban all single-use plastics right away without worrying about economic effects. While I understand the environmental concerns, I mostly disagree with this extreme approach.\n\nPlastic pollution is definitely a major problem that needs urgent action. Our oceans are full of plastic waste that kills marine animals and enters our food chain. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose, and we produce millions of tons every year. Many countries are already suffering from plastic waste problems, with polluted beaches and rivers. This shows why people want immediate action.\n\nHowever, banning all single-use plastics immediately would cause serious problems. Many industries depend on plastic packaging, especially food and medicine. Hospitals need sterile plastic equipment to keep patients safe. If we ban plastics suddenly, many businesses would close and people would lose jobs. Poor countries might not have alternatives available, making the situation worse for them. The economic damage could be enormous.\n\nFurthermore, we need time to develop good alternatives. Paper bags use more energy to make and aren't always better for the environment. Reusable items need proper cleaning facilities which many places don't have. Without proper planning, we might create new environmental problems.\n\nA better solution would be gradual change. Governments should ban unnecessary plastics first, like shopping bags and straws, while supporting research into alternatives. They should help businesses transition slowly and educate people about reducing plastic use.\n\nIn conclusion, while plastic pollution is serious, immediate total bans would cause too much economic harm. We need balanced policies that protect both the environment and people's livelihoods.",
