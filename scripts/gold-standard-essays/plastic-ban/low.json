  "essayText": "I dont agree government should ban all plastic immediately without thinking about economy. This too extreme and will cause many problem.\n\nYes plastic very bad for environment. Ocean have too much plastic garbage and fish dying. Turtle eat plastic bag thinking its jellyfish. Beach very dirty with plastic bottle everywhere. This make me very sad when I see. We definitely need do something about plastic pollution because getting worse everyday.\n\nBut if government ban all plastic tomorrow, big disaster will happen. Many company will close because they need plastic for packaging. Million of people will lose job. How they feed family? Also hospital need plastic syringe and glove to keep clean. Without plastic maybe more people get sick from dirty equipment. Food also need plastic to stay fresh. Without plastic wrap, food spoil faster and people waste more.\n\nPoor country will suffer most because they dont have money to buy alternative. Rich country maybe can afford paper or glass but poor country cannot. This not fair for them.\n\nAnother problem is we dont have good replacement yet. Paper bag also bad for environment because need cut tree. Glass very heavy and break easy, dangerous for children.\n\nBetter solution is ban plastic slowly. First ban plastic bag and straw because not so important. Give company time to find alternative. Government should help with money for research new material.\n\nIn conclusion immediate ban too dangerous for economy. We need careful planning to protect environment and economy together.",
