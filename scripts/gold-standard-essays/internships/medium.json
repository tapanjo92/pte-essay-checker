  "essayText": "Unpaid internships are common in many industries today, but people disagree about whether they are fair. Some think they exploit young people, while others believe they provide important experience. Both views have valid points.\n\nThose who oppose unpaid internships argue they are unfair to workers. Young people do real work that helps companies but receive no payment. This means only students from wealthy families can afford these opportunities, because they need financial support while working for free. Poor students must take paid jobs instead, missing chances to gain experience in their chosen field. Additionally, some companies use unpaid interns to replace paid employees, which is wrong.\n\nHowever, supporters say unpaid internships offer valuable benefits. Students gain practical experience that universities cannot provide. They learn how their industry really works and develop professional skills. Internships also help students build networks and meet potential employers. Many companies hire their best interns after graduation, so these positions can lead to good jobs. For students, the experience and connections may be worth more than temporary wages.\n\nIn my opinion, unpaid internships can be acceptable if they truly focus on education. Companies should provide real training, mentorship, and meaningful projects. However, if interns do regular employee work, they deserve payment. The government should create clear rules about what unpaid internships can include.\n\nIn conclusion, while unpaid internships can provide learning opportunities, many exploit young workers. Better regulations would ensure internships benefit students rather than providing free labor for companies.",
