  "essayText": "Unpaid internship is big issue today. Some people think its exploitation but other think its good for learning. I will discuss both view.\n\nPeople against unpaid internship have good point. Young people work hard but get no money. This very unfair because they doing same job like employee but no salary. Only rich student can do because parent give money for living. Poor student cannot do internship because need money for food and rent. Company save money by using free worker instead of paying salary. This like modern slavery where people work for nothing.\n\nBut some people support unpaid internship. They say student learn alot from working in real company. University only teach theory but internship teach practical skill. Student can meet important people who help them get job later. Many company hire their intern after finish study. So even no money now but good investment for future. Also student can put internship in CV which make them look experienced.\n\nHowever I think unpaid internship mostly bad. If company really want help student, they should pay at least minimum wage. Student also have expense like transport and lunch. How they suppose to pay without money? Only rich kid can afford work for free. This create inequality in society.\n\nIn my opinion government should make law that all internship must paid. Maybe not full salary but at least something for basic need. This more fair for everyone.\n\nTo conclude unpaid internship have some benefit but disadvantage more serious. Young people deserve payment for their work.",
