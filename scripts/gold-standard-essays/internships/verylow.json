  "essayText": "Some people say unpaid internship bad some say good. Both have reason.\n\nUnpaid internship bad because no money. Student work hard but company not pay. This not fair. Rich student can do because parent have money. Poor student cannot do must find job with salary. Company use student for free work very bad.\n\nBut other people think internship good for learn. Student get experience from real job. In school only book but internship real work. Maybe get job after internship finish. Good for CV also.\n\nI think unpaid internship not good. If work must get pay. Student also need money for bus and food. How can work if no money? Only rich people child can do.\n\nGovernment must make rule company pay intern. Not fair young people work free.\n\nSo unpaid internship maybe little bit good but mostly bad. Student should get money for work.",
