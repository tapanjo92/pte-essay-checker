  "essayText": "I agree climate change is biggest threat for humanity today. Its already affecting whole world and getting worse everyday.\n\nFirst reason climate change so dangerous is weather becoming extreme. In my country we having more flood than before and sometime very hot temperature that never happen in past. Many farmer losing crop because rain come at wrong time or no rain at all. This making food price going up and poor people suffering more. Also ice melting in north pole causing sea level rise which dangerous for people living near ocean.\n\nAnother point is climate change affecting health of people. When temperature increase, disease like malaria spreading to new area. Air pollution also getting worse in city which causing breathing problem for children and old people. Hospital becoming full during heat wave. My grandmother get sick last summer because too hot.\n\nSome people thinking other problem like war or poverty more important than climate change. But I think climate change making these problem worse. When no water or food because climate change, people will fight for resource. This can cause war between country.\n\nHowever, not too late to solve problem if all country work together. We need use clean energy like solar and wind instead coal and oil. People also need change lifestyle like using public transport.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change definitely biggest threat because affecting everything in our life. If we not acting now, future generation will suffer more serious consequence.",
