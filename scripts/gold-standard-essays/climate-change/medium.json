  "essayText": "I strongly agree that climate change is the biggest threat to humanity today. The effects are already visible everywhere and will get much worse if we don't act quickly.\n\nFirstly, climate change affects everyone on Earth. Rising temperatures cause ice caps to melt, which raises sea levels. Many coastal cities like Miami and Venice are already flooding more often. Scientists predict millions of people will lose their homes in the next decades. This is different from other problems that only affect some countries.\n\nSecondly, climate change damages our food supply. Droughts and floods destroy crops, making food more expensive. Poor countries suffer the most because they cannot afford to import food. This leads to hunger and conflicts over resources. We saw this happen in Syria where drought contributed to civil war.\n\nSome people argue that nuclear war or diseases are bigger threats. While these are serious, they might never happen. Climate change is happening right now and getting worse every year. We can see the evidence in extreme weather, dying coral reefs, and extinct animals.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe climate change is definitely our biggest threat because it affects everything - our homes, food, health, and security. We need immediate action from all countries to reduce emissions and protect our planet for future generations.",
