  "essayText": "I dont agree online education more effective than classroom. Traditional classroom still better for most student.\n\nFirst problem with online education is no real teacher there. In classroom teacher can see if student understand or confuse. Online class just video on screen, teacher cannot help individual student. When I try online course last year very difficult because nobody to ask question immediately. Must wait email reply maybe take long time.\n\nSecond, online education have many distraction. At home student can open Facebook or YouTube while class happening. Parent or sibling making noise. In school everyone focus on study together. My friend fail online class because always playing game during lesson. This never happen in real classroom because teacher watching.\n\nAlso online education need good internet and computer. Many student dont have fast internet or new laptop. When connection bad, video freeze and miss important information. Poor family cannot afford good equipment for online study. In classroom everyone have same opportunity.\n\nBut online education also have some good point. Can study anytime convenient. If sick still can watch lesson from bed. Also cheaper because no need transport to school.\n\nHowever, classroom learning give better result. Student learn discipline and social skill. Can do group work and make friend. Teacher can explain difficult concept many different way until student understand.\n\nIn conclusion online education maybe good for some people but traditional classroom more effective for proper learning. Face to face teaching always better than computer screen.",
