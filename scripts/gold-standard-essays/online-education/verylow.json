  "essayText": "Online education not effective like classroom. I disagree online better.\n\nClassroom have teacher can explain good. Online only computer no real person. Student cannot ask question get answer fast. Teacher in class can see student face know if understand or not.\n\nOnline class very boring just watch screen. Easy to not pay attention. In classroom must listen because teacher there. Also friend in class help each other learn.\n\nOnline need computer and internet. Many people no have. If internet slow cannot see video. Very frustrating. In classroom no need technology just go and learn.\n\nBut online can study at home. No need go school save time. Can watch video again if not understand first time.\n\nStill classroom better because teacher help directly. Can do experiment and activity together. Online cannot do this thing.\n\nSo online education not good as classroom. Need real teacher and classmate for good learning.",
