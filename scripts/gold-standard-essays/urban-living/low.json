  "essayText": "Many people moving to big city nowadays instead of staying in village. This trend have good and bad points but I think advantage more than disadvantage.\n\nCity life have many benefit. First, job opportunity very good in city. Many company and factory in city so easy find work. Salary also higher than village job. My brother move to city last year and now earning double money. Education also better in city. Good school and university all in city. If want good education for children must go city. Hospital and doctor also better. In village only small clinic but city have big hospital with all equipment.\n\nBut city life also have problem. Everything very expensive especially house. Many people cannot afford good house so live in small flat with many people. Traffic jam everyday waste too much time. Air pollution very bad, make people sick. Also in city people not friendly like village. Everyone busy and dont care about neighbor. Crime also more in city because too many people.\n\nHowever I still think city better than village. Even with all problem, city give more chance for better life. People can find job and make money. Children can get good education. When sick can go good hospital. In village life peaceful but no opportunity to improve.\n\nIn conclusion advantage of city life outweigh disadvantage. That why so many people choose leave village and go to city for better future.",
