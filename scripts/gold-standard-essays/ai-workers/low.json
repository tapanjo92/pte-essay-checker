  "essayText": "Artificial intelligence getting stronger everyday and many people afraid losing job. I disagree AI will replace all human because human have special ability that computer dont have.\n\nFirst, AI already taking some job from people. In factory, robot doing work faster than human. Computer can calculate number better than accountant. Even driving job in danger because self-driving car coming soon. My uncle lost job in factory because robot cheaper than paying salary. This show AI really affecting employment.\n\nBut human still important for many work. Doctor need to care about patient feeling not just give medicine. Teacher must understand when student having problem at home. Restaurant waiter need to be friendly and make customer happy. Computer cannot do this emotional work. Also human more creative than AI. We can think new idea and solve problem in different way.\n\nAnother point is AI also creating new job. Someone need to make the AI program and fix when broken. My friend now learning coding because many company need people who understand AI. So maybe we lose some job but get new job too.\n\nMoreover, AI expensive to install. Small business cannot afford buying AI system. They still need human worker for long time. Also customer sometime prefer talking to real person not machine.\n\nIn conclusion, AI will change job market but not make human unnecessary. Human have emotion and creativity that AI cannot replace. We should learn new skill to work together with AI instead of worry about replacement.",
