  "essayText": "Artificial intelligence is developing very quickly and many people worry about their jobs. While AI will change how we work, I disagree that it will make human workers completely unnecessary because humans have special skills that computers cannot copy.\n\nIt is true that AI is already replacing some workers. In factories, robots now do jobs that people used to do, like assembling cars and packaging products. Banks use AI to approve loans instead of human workers reviewing applications. Even in creative fields, AI can now write articles and create artwork. Self-checkout machines in supermarkets have reduced the need for cashiers. These examples show that AI is taking over many routine jobs.\n\nHowever, humans are still necessary for many important jobs. Doctors and nurses need to show compassion and understand patients' emotions, which AI cannot do. Teachers must inspire and motivate students, adapting their methods to each child's needs. Artists and musicians create original works that express human experiences and emotions. Business leaders make complex decisions considering many factors that AI might miss. These jobs require human judgment, creativity, and emotional understanding.\n\nFurthermore, new technology usually creates new types of jobs. When computers were invented, people worried about unemployment, but many new jobs appeared in IT and software development. The same will happen with AI - we will need people to design, program, and maintain AI systems.\n\nIn conclusion, although AI will eliminate some jobs, human workers will always be necessary for tasks requiring emotional intelligence, creativity, and complex thinking. We should prepare for changes but not fear complete replacement.",
