  "essayText": "I disagre that AI make human unnecessary. AI is just computer program not real person.\n\nFirst AI cannot do all job. Computer cannot fix pipe or build house. Need human hand for this work. Also computer cannot be teacher because student need real person to understand feeling. My teacher help me when sad but computer cannot do.\n\nSecond AI make mistake sometime. Last week I use ChatGPT for homework but answer wrong. If pilot job replace by AI and AI make mistake plane will crash. Very dangerous. Human more careful than computer.\n\nBut some people say AI is very smart and getting smarter. Maybe oneday AI can do everything. I still think human important because we have feeling and creative. Computer just follow program.\n\nIn conclusion AI cannot replace human because human special and have emotion. We should use AI to help us not replace us.",
