  "essayText": "I disagree with prioritizing space exploration funding over Earth's problems. While space research is important, our planet's immediate issues need more urgent attention and resources.\n\nFirst, many serious problems on Earth require immediate solutions. Millions of people lack access to clean water, food, and basic healthcare. Climate change is causing natural disasters that destroy communities and threaten future generations. These problems affect real people right now, while space exploration benefits are mostly theoretical or far in the future. Governments should focus on helping citizens who are suffering today.\n\nSecond, the cost of space programs is enormous. A single space mission can cost billions of dollars, money that could build hospitals, schools, or renewable energy systems. For example, the Mars rover program cost over $2 billion, which could have provided clean water to millions or funded cancer research. When people are dying from preventable diseases, spending on space seems irresponsible.\n\nHowever, space exploration does have some benefits. It leads to new technologies that can help on Earth, like satellite communications and weather monitoring. Space research also inspires young people to study science and engineering. Some argue we need to find other planets in case Earth becomes uninhabitable.\n\nDespite these advantages, Earth's problems are too urgent to ignore. We should solve issues like poverty, disease, and environmental destruction before investing heavily in space. Once basic human needs are met, then governments can increase space funding.\n\nIn conclusion, while space exploration has value, governments must prioritize solving Earth's immediate problems first. Human welfare and planetary health should come before cosmic ambitions.",
