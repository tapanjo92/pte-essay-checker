  "essayText": "I dont agree government should spend more money on space than earth problem. This is very bad idea because many people suffering on earth need help first.\n\nEarth have too many problem need fixing. Poor people everywhere cannot eat food or drink clean water. Many country have war and people dying. Hospital dont have enough doctor and medicine. School also very bad in poor area, children cannot learn properly. Why government want explore space when people on earth suffering so much? This make no sense to me.\n\nSpace exploration very expensive. Rocket cost billion dollar to build and launch. If crash then all money waste. This money better use for help poor people and build hospital. My country need more school but government talking about going to moon. Very frustrating for normal people who need help.\n\nSome people say space exploration good for technology. Maybe true but technology not help if people hungry. Also they say maybe we find new planet to live. But this stupid idea because we already have good planet just need take care of it better.\n\nIn my opinion government must fix earth problem first before think about space. When no more poverty and everyone have good life, then can explore space. But now is not right time. Too many people need help on earth.\n\nIn conclusion space exploration waste of money when earth have so many problem. Government should use tax money help citizen not send rocket to space.",
