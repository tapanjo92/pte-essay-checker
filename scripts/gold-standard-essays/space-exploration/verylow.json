  "essayText": "I think government should not spend money for space when earth have problem. This wrong priority and not fair for people who suffering.\n\nFirst earth problem very serious. Many people no have food and water. Children dying because no medicine. My country have many poor people living street. They need help now not tomorrow. But government want spend money for going mars. This crazy thinking. How can go to mars when people hungry in earth?\n\nSpace very expensive and dangerous. Rocket sometime explode and astronaut die. All money gone when this happen. Better use money for hospital and school. One rocket cost can build many hospital. \n\nSome people say space good for tecnology but I dont agree. We have enough tecnology already. What we need is help poor people and fix environment. Earth getting hot and ice melting but government looking at star instead of fixing earth.\n\nSpace exploration just for rich country to show off. They want to say we reach moon first or we have best rocket. But this not important when people suffering. Is like buying expensive car when your children hungry.\n\nIn conclusion government must stop wasting money on space and help earth first. After everyone have good life then maybe can think about space. But now wrong time.",
