  "essayText": "Youth unemployment getting worse everywhere. Many young people cannot find job after finish school. This very serious problem need to solve quickly.\n\nWhy young people cannot find job? First reason is company want experienced worker not fresh graduate. They dont want spend time and money for training. Young people stuck because need job to get experience but need experience to get job. Very frustrating situation.\n\nSecond cause is technology taking away job. Computer and robot doing work that young people use to do. Factory dont need many worker anymore because machine do everything. Even in office, software replacing people.\n\nEducation system also problem. School teach theory but not practical skill. When graduate, student dont know what employer want. They study many year but still not ready for real job. This waste of time and money.\n\nEconomy also bad in many country. When economy bad, company not hiring. They keep old worker and not give chance to young people. In my country, many graduate become unemployed because no job available.\n\nFor solution, government must help. They can give money to company who hire young people. Also make program for young people learn skill and get experience. School should change what they teach to match what company need.\n\nYoung people also can start own business if cannot find job. Government should give loan and training for this.\n\nIn conclusion youth unemployment caused by many thing like no experience, technology, bad education and economy. Need everyone work together to fix this problem.",
