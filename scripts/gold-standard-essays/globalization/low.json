  "essayText": "Globalization is when countries trade with each other more easy. This have good and bad effects. I think advantages is more than disadvantages but both are important to discuss.\n\nGood things about globalization is many. First, products become cheap because made in country where labor cheap. We can buy many things from different country like phone from China or car from Japan. This good for consumer who save money. Also globalization create job in poor country. Many factory open in Bangladesh or Vietnam and give work to people there. This help them escape poverty. Another advantage is we learn about other culture through food, movie and music from different country.\n\nBut globalization also have problem. Many people in rich country lose job because factory move to poor country. This make them angry and poor. Also small shop cannot compete with big international company like McDonald or Starbucks. Local culture disappear when everyone wear same clothes and eat same food. Environment also suffer because factory in poor country not follow rules and create pollution.\n\nEven with these problem, I still think advantage bigger. More people have job and can buy things they need. Countries work together instead of fighting. Poor country can develop faster by trading. If government help people who lose job and protect environment, globalization can be good for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, globalization have both positive and negative effect but positive is stronger. World become better when country cooperate and trade together.",
