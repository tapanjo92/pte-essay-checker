  "essayText": "Globalization mean country do business together with no barrier. Some people say good some people say bad. I think have both but more good than bad.\n\nAdvantage of globalization alot. Can buy cheap thing from other country. Like clothes from China very cheap compare to local made. Poor country get job when rich country company come and build factory. People can travel easy to other country for work or tourist. Also can try food from everywhere like pizza sushi burger all available now. Internet make everything connect together.\n\nDisadvantage also there. Local people no job because company go to cheap country. Small shop close because cannot fight with big company from outside. Young people forget own culture and only like western thing. Pollution increase because poor country factory not care environment just want make money. Rich become richer poor become poorer.\n\nBut I still think globalization good overall. Help poor country develop. Make life easy for everyone. If government smart can solve the problem. Maybe give training to worker who lose job. Maybe make rule for environment protection.\n\nGlobalization cannot stop anyway. World already connect together. Better to accept and try make it work good for everyone. In conclusion advantage more than disadvantage if handle properly.",
