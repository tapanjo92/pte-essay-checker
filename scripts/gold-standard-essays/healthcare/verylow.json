Country like canada have free healthcare.\n\nBut free healthcare expensive. Who pay? Tax payer pay everything. Not fair for healthy people. Also people go doctor too much if free. Waiting time very long.\n\nPay healthcare mean better service. Private hospital more good equipment. Doctor work harder.\n\nI think both way have problem. Maybe some free some pay better.\n\nSo healthcare difficult issue. Every country different solution.",
