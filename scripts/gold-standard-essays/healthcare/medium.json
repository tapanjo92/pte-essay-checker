  "essayText": "Healthcare is an important issue in every country. Some people believe it should be free for everyone, while others think patients should pay for medical services. Both sides have good arguments that need to be considered.\n\nThose who support free healthcare say it is a basic human right. Everyone should be able to see a doctor when they are sick, regardless of how much money they have. Countries with free healthcare like Canada show that this system can work well. When healthcare is free, people go to the doctor for small problems before they become serious, which saves money in the long run. Also, nobody should lose their home or savings because of medical bills.\n\nOn the other hand, people who believe in paid healthcare have valid points too. Free healthcare is very expensive for governments and requires high taxes. This means working people pay for others' medical costs. Some argue that when people pay for healthcare, they value it more and don't waste doctors' time with minor issues. Private healthcare often has shorter waiting times and better facilities because of competition between hospitals.\n\nIn my opinion, the best solution is a mixed system. Basic healthcare like emergency treatment and essential medicines should be free for all citizens. However, optional services like cosmetic surgery or private rooms could require payment. This ensures everyone gets necessary care while keeping the system affordable.\n\nIn conclusion, while both free and paid healthcare have advantages, a combination of both systems would provide the best outcome for society.",
