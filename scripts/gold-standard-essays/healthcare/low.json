  "essayText": "Healthcare is important topic today. Some people think government should give free healthcare but other think people must pay. I will discuss both opinion.\n\nPeople who want free healthcare say everyone deserve to be healthy. Poor people cannot pay doctor so they stay sick or die. This not fair in modern society. If healthcare free, all people can get treatment when need. In UK healthcare free and people happy with system. Also when people get treatment early, they not need expensive surgery later.\n\nBut other people say free healthcare too expensive. Government must use tax money to pay hospital and doctor salary. Working people angry because they pay tax for other people medical bill. Also if healthcare free, people go doctor for small problem like cold. This waste doctor time and make waiting list very long. Private hospital better quality because they compete for customer.\n\nAnother problem with free healthcare is people not take care of health. If they know treatment free, they eat unhealthy food and not exercise. But if must pay, they more careful about health.\n\nIn my opinion, basic healthcare should free but not everything. Emergency and important treatment free but cosmetic surgery people must pay. Poor people get help but system still have money.\n\nTo conclude both system have good and bad point. Best is mix both together so everyone can get healthcare but also system can survive.",
