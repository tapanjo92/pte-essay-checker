  "essayText": "Now many people work from house not go office. This big change for everyone. Have good thing and bad thing about this.\n\nGood thing about work at home is save time. No need go office everyday waste time in traffic. Can sleep more. Also save money no need buy petrol or train ticket. Can wear anything want nobody see. Eat food from kitchen anytime hungry. If tired can lie down on bed for while then continue work.\n\nBad thing is very boring at home alone whole day. No friend to talk or joke. Only computer to look at. Sometime internet not working then cannot do anything. Boss think you lazy at home maybe not working. Very hard to concentrate when family making noise or TV on. \n\nAlso bad for health because sit all day no walking. In office at least walk to meeting room or canteen. At home just sit on chair whole day get fat. Eye also pain from looking screen too long.\n\nSome people like work from home some people dont like. Depend on person. Young people maybe like because they good with computer. Old people maybe dont like because they not use to technology.\n\nWork from home change everything about job. Some good some bad but cannot go back to old way already. Everyone must accept this new way of working.",
