  "essayText": "Remote work is when people work from home instead of going to office. This become very popular after covid pandemic. It have good and bad points that change how we work.\n\nGood things about remote work is many. First, no need wake up early and sit in traffic jam for hours. Can wake up later and start work immediately. Save money on petrol and parking also. Second advantage is can work in pajamas and comfortable clothes. No need buy expensive office clothes. Also can eat home food which is cheaper and healthier than outside food. Some people say they work better at home because no colleague disturb them. Can take break whenever want.\n\nBut remote work also got problems. Main problem is feeling lonely because no friends at work to talk. Only see people on computer screen which not same as real life. Also difficult to stop working because computer always there. Some people work until very late because boss keep sending email. House become very messy because work papers everywhere. Children and family also disturb when trying to work. Internet connection sometimes bad and video call keep freezing.\n\nAnother issue is promotion become difficult. Boss cannot see you working hard so maybe forget about you when promotion time. New employee also difficult to learn job when nobody around to teach properly.\n\nIn conclusion, work from home have advantages and disadvantages. Need to find balance between home and office work. Maybe work home three days and office two days is better solution.",
