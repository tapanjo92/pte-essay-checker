  "essayText": "I agree social media influencer have more impact on young people today than parent and teacher. This is big problem for society.\n\nYoung people spend many hour everyday on social media looking at influencer. They watch YouTube, Instagram, TikTok all the time. Influencer show perfect life with expensive thing and young people want copy them. My cousin always talking about her favorite influencer and want buy same clothes and makeup. She dont listen to parent anymore only care what influencer say.\n\nTeacher and parent cannot compete with influencer because not interesting like social media. When teacher talk about study, student thinking about TikTok video. Parent try give good advice but children say influencer know better about modern life. Also influencer more fun and entertaining so young people prefer watching them.\n\nBut this very dangerous because influencer only want make money. They dont care about young people future just want them buy product. Many influencer promote unhealthy thing like extreme diet or dangerous challenge. Parent and teacher actually care about children but young people dont realize.\n\nHowever some good influencer exist who teach useful thing. But most influencer bad influence on youth. They make young people materialistic and unrealistic about life.\n\nIn conclusion I strongly agree that influencer have too much impact on young people. Parent and teacher influence becoming weaker. This will cause many problem for future generation.",
