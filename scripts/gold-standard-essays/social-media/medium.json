  "essayText": "Social media influencers have become very powerful in recent years, especially among young people. While they do have significant influence, I partially disagree that they have more impact than parents and teachers overall.\n\nInfluencers certainly affect young people's daily choices and behaviors. They shape fashion trends, lifestyle choices, and consumer habits through constant social media presence. Young people spend hours watching influencer content and often trust their recommendations more than traditional advertising. Many teenagers aspire to become influencers themselves, seeing it as an attractive career path. Influencers also discuss topics that young people find relevant, like relationships, mental health, and social issues, in ways that feel more relatable than advice from adults.\n\nHowever, parents and teachers still have deeper influence on important life aspects. Parents shape children's core values, beliefs, and personality from birth. They provide emotional support, discipline, and guidance through daily interactions over many years. Teachers educate young people, develop their critical thinking skills, and help them prepare for future careers. These traditional role models know young people personally and can provide individualized support.\n\nThe key difference is the type of influence. Influencers mainly affect surface-level choices like entertainment preferences, fashion, and consumer behavior. Parents and teachers influence fundamental aspects like character development, education, and life skills. While influencer impact is more visible on social media, traditional role models' influence runs deeper.\n\nIn conclusion, although social media influencers have gained considerable influence over young people's lifestyle choices, parents and teachers maintain stronger impact on core development and long-term success. Both types of influence coexist rather than replace each other.",
