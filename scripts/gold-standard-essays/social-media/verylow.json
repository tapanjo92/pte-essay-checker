  "essayText": "Influencer very popular now. Young people like them more than parent teacher. I agree this true.\n\nYoung people always on phone watch influencer. They want be like them have nice thing. My sister watch makeup video all day want buy everything.\n\nParent teacher boring for young people. They talk about study and rule but influencer talk about fun thing. Young people not listen parent anymore.\n\nInfluencer bad because only want money. They tell young people buy thing not necessary. Make them feel bad if not have expensive thing.\n\nBut some influencer good teach useful thing. Not all bad.\n\nParent teacher more important but young people dont know. They should listen family not stranger on internet.\n\nSo yes influencer have big impact on youth today. This problem for society.",
