  "essayText": "University education very expensive nowadays. Some people think government should pay for all student but other say student must pay themself. I will discuss both view.\n\nPeople who support free education have good reason. Poor family cannot send children to university because too expensive. This not fair because smart children from poor family cannot get good job. If education free, everyone have same chance for success. Also country benefit when more people educated because they become doctor, engineer and teacher. In some country like Sweden, education already free and working good.\n\nBut free education also have problem. First, government need lot of money to pay for everyone university. This money come from tax so working people must pay more tax. Some people never go university so they angry about paying tax for other people education. Also if education free, maybe student not serious about study because they not paying. University might become too crowded and quality go down.\n\nAnother issue is government already spending money on hospital, road and police. If spend too much on university, other service suffer. Private university also cannot compete with free university so they might close.\n\nIn my opinion, government should help poor student with scholarship but not make everything free. Rich family can pay for their children. This way help people who really need but not waste money.\n\nTo conclude, free university education good idea but not practical for most country. Better to have mix system where government help some student.",
