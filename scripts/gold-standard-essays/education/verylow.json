  "topic": "University education should be free for all students. Discuss both views and give your opinion.",
  "essayText": "Some people say university should free but other disagree. Both have good point.\n\nFree education good because poor student can go university. Many smart people no money for study. If free everyone can learn and get good job. Country need educated people for develop.\n\nBut free education also problem. Who pay for it? Government no have enough money. Tax payer angry if they pay for other people study. Also student maybe lazy if not pay money. They not value education.\n\nSome country already have free university like germany. But most country cannot do because too expensive.\n\nI think government help poor student but not all free. Rich people can pay. This more fair.\n\nSo free education have advantage and disadvantage. Each country must decide what best for them.",
