  "essayText": "The cost of university education is a controversial topic worldwide. Some believe it should be free for everyone, while others think students should pay. Both views have valid points worth considering.\n\nSupporters of free education argue it creates equal opportunities. When university is free, poor students can attend and improve their lives. Countries like Germany and Norway offer free education and have successful economies. Free education also benefits society because more educated people means better workers and more innovation. Additionally, graduates without debt can spend money on houses and businesses instead of loan payments.\n\nOn the other hand, free education has drawbacks. Taxpayers must pay higher taxes to fund universities, which some find unfair if they didn't attend university themselves. Free education might also reduce the value of degrees if everyone has one. Some argue that paying fees makes students more serious about their studies and less likely to waste time.\n\nFurthermore, governments have limited budgets and might need to spend money on healthcare or infrastructure instead of free university. Private funding from student fees allows universities to maintain quality facilities and attract good professors.\n\nIn my opinion, a mixed approach works best. Governments should provide free education for students from low-income families and courses that society needs like nursing or teaching. Other students can pay reasonable fees with access to low-interest loans. This balances accessibility with financial sustainability.",
