  "essayText": "Today many people use card to pay not cash. I think this have good and bad point.\n\nGood thing about digital payment is easy to use. No need carry money in pocket. Can pay with phone very fast. Also if lose card can call bank to stop. But if lose cash money gone forever. Online shopping need card to pay.\n\nBad thing is sometime card not working. Last week I go restaurant and machine broken so cannot pay. Very embarrassing. Old people dont understand how use card or phone payment. My grandfather still use cash only.\n\nAlso hacker can steal from bank account. This very scary. With cash no one can hack. Privacy also problem because bank know everything we buy.\n\nI think both cash and card important. Cannot only have one because too risky. Need backup option always.\n\nIn conclusion digital payment good but not replace cash completely.",
