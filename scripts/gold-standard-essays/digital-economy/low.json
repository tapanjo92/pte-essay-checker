  "essayText": "Nowadays many country becoming cashless society. People use card and phone to pay everything. This have good and bad points but I think disadvantage more than advantage.\n\nAdvantage of digital payment is convenient. No need carry heavy coin and paper money. Just bring phone or card can buy anything. Also safer because thief cannot steal digital money easy like cash. Online shopping also very easy with digital payment. Can buy from anywhere in world. Transaction also fast no need wait for change.\n\nBut many problem with cashless society. First, old people dont know how use technology. My grandmother cannot use smartphone so how she buy things? Also poor people maybe no have bank account or smartphone. This unfair for them. \n\nAnother big problem is when system down cannot buy anything. Last month bank system crash and many people cannot pay for food. Very dangerous rely only on technology. Also government and company can track every purchase. No privacy anymore they know everything we buy.\n\nHacker also big threat. They can steal money from account and very difficult get back. With cash this not happen. Also many small shop must pay fee for card machine. This expensive for them.\n\nIn conclusion cashless society have some benefit but too many risk. We should keep both cash and digital payment not only one. This safer for everyone.",
