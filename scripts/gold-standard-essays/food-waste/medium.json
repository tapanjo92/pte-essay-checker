  "essayText": "Food waste has become a serious problem in rich countries while many people in poor nations do not have enough to eat. This unfair situation has several causes and needs urgent solutions.\n\nThe main causes of food waste in developed countries are related to lifestyle and shopping habits. People often buy more food than they need because of special offers and bulk discounts. Many consumers throw away food that looks imperfect even though it is still good to eat. Restaurants serve very large portions, and customers cannot finish their meals. Supermarkets also waste food when products reach their sell-by date, even if the food is still safe.\n\nAnother important cause is lack of awareness. People in rich countries have never experienced hunger, so they do not value food properly. They do not understand that wasting food also wastes water, energy, and other resources used in production. The low cost of food compared to income makes people careless about throwing it away.\n\nTo solve this problem, several measures should be taken. Governments need to create laws that encourage supermarkets to donate unsold food instead of throwing it away. Schools should teach children about food waste and its impact on the environment. New technology like mobile apps can help connect people who have extra food with those who need it. Restaurants could offer different portion sizes to reduce waste.\n\nIn conclusion, food waste is caused by overconsumption and lack of awareness in wealthy nations. Through education, technology, and better policies, we can reduce waste and help feed hungry people.",
