  "essayText": "Four day work week should be standard or not? I think no good idea.\n\nSome say four day good. People happy work less. More time for family. But I think problem more than benefit.\n\nFirst hospital doctor nurse cannot work four day only. Sick people everyday need help. Shop restaurant same problem customer come everyday want buy thing eat food. How can close?\n\nSecond money problem. If work four day get less money? Worker not happy. If same money company not happy pay same for less work. Both way problem.\n\nThird what about other country? If we four day they five day we lose business. Company go to other country.\n\nSo I think four day not good for all. Maybe some job ok but not all job. Cannot make same rule everyone different job different need.\n\nTo sum up four day work week sound nice but real life too much problem.",
