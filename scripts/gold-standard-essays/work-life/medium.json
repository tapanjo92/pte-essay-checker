  "essayText": "The idea of making four-day work weeks standard in developed countries has gained popularity recently. While this proposal has some benefits, I mostly disagree because it may not work for all industries and could cause economic problems.\n\nSupporters of four-day weeks point to several advantages. Studies show that employees become more productive when working fewer days, as they feel more motivated and less stressed. Companies in New Zealand and Spain have tested this model successfully. Workers report better mental health and more time for family activities. Additionally, fewer commuting days help reduce traffic congestion and pollution in cities. Some argue that automation and technology make shorter weeks possible without losing productivity.\n\nHowever, implementing four-day weeks everywhere faces serious challenges. Many businesses like hospitals, restaurants, and shops need to stay open every day to serve customers. These sectors would need to hire more staff, increasing costs significantly. Manufacturing companies with expensive equipment cannot afford to reduce operating days. Small businesses might struggle to compete if they close an extra day each week. Furthermore, coordinating with international partners becomes difficult when different countries follow different schedules.\n\nIn my opinion, four-day weeks should remain optional rather than mandatory. Some industries like technology and finance might benefit from this model. However, forcing all businesses to adopt it ignores practical realities. Governments should allow companies to choose what works best for their situation.\n\nIn conclusion, while four-day work weeks offer benefits for work-life balance, making them standard across all developed countries is impractical and potentially harmful to many businesses.",
