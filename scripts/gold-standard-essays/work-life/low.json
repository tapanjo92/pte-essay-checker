  "essayText": "Some people think all develop country should have four day work week as standard. I disagree with this idea because it cause many problem for business and economy.\n\nPeople who support four day week say it good for worker. They say worker more happy and productive when work less day. Also they have more time with family and for hobby. Some company already try this and say it work good. Worker feel less stress and more energy. This can help mental health problem that many people have from too much work.\n\nBut there are many problem with make four day week for everyone. First, many job cannot do this. Hospital need open every day, sick people cannot wait. Restaurant and shop also need serve customer all week. If these place close one more day, people will angry. Second, small business will suffer. They cannot compete if close extra day when other business in different country still open. Also, who will pay worker same money for less day? Company may cut salary which bad for worker.\n\nAnother issue is different country have different system. If one country do four day but neighbor country still five day, this make trade and business very difficult. Meeting and delivery become complicated.\n\nIn my opinion four day work week not good idea for all company. Maybe some office job can do but not everyone. Government should let company decide what best for them.\n\nTo conclude, four day week have some benefit but too many problem to make standard everywhere. Each business different and need different solution.",
