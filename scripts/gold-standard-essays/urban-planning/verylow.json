Can walk easy no danger from car.\n\nBut car important for people. Old people need car cannot walk far. Mother with baby need car for shopping. No car how go hospital emergency? Shop need delivery truck bring thing to sell.\n\nI think no ban all car. Maybe some car ok but not all. Need good bus first.\n\nSo both side have point. Car bad for air but people need for life. Must find middle way.",
