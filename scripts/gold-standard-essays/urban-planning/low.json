  "essayText": "Some people think car should ban from city center but other people say need car for freedom. Both side have good point to consider.\n\nPeople who want ban car have reason. City center very polluted because too many car. Air quality bad and people get sick from breathing dirty air. Also traffic jam everywhere waste time. If no car, people can walk freely and enjoy city. Some city in Europe already do this and working good. More space for walking and sitting outside cafe. Also safer for children and old people cross street.\n\nBut other people disagree with ban. They say car important for daily life. What about disable people who cannot walk or take bus? They need car to go places. Also parent with small children need car for shopping and taking kids to school. If ban car, how delivery truck bring goods to shop? Business will suffer if customer cannot drive there. Public transport not always good especially at night or weekend.\n\nIn my opinion, complete ban too extreme. Better to have some restriction but not total ban. Maybe charge money for driving in city center so less people bring car. Or only allow car certain time of day. Also need improve bus and train first before ban car.\n\nGovernment should think careful about this issue. Both environment and people need important.\n\nIn conclusion banning car have advantage for environment but cause problem for many people. Need find balance between clean air and people freedom to travel.",
